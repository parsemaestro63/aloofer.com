  # Building Aloofer

  Aloofer came about by a long time desire to create my own blog, combined with attending a local Meetup introducing me to Gatsby.

  ## Short but Sweet Journey

  The basics were put together by following the [Gatsby starter project](https://github.com/dandenney/gatsby-starter-meetup.git) (credit to Dan Denny) commit by commit, and applying relevant changes to Aloofer.
  Along the way I familiarized with Gatsby basics, and reviewed the corresponding documentation of various components built.

  ___The creation process___:

  1. Clone the [starter project](https://github.com/dandenney/gatsby-starter-meetup.git) from the Meetup, and change Git configuration to point Aloofer's repository
  2. Reset Git to the forked project's HEAD (the [Gatsby Starter Default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) project)
  3. Separately open the starter project in Github
  4. And manually apply changes introduced in each commit as applicable to Aloofer


  So far, my Gatsby experience is mostly positive. Of course, as I continue building Aloofer, I'll form more of an opinion on the framework.
